Haar Cascades is a machine learning technique used for object detection, like recognizing faces in images or videos. It works by using features from the image, such as areas of light and dark, to identify specific patterns that could be an object. To make this process faster and more accurate, Haar Cascades first calculate these features using a technique called integral images, which speeds up the calculations. Then, a method called Adaboost selects the best features and combines them to create a strong classifier. Finally, cascading classifiers are used to quickly reject irrelevant parts of the image, allowing the system to focus only on areas that might contain the object. 

We chose to use the Python packages opencv-python and face_recognition for our face recognition security system because they provide powerful and efficient methods for facial detection and recognition.

OpenCV: This package is widely used for computer vision tasks. It helps us with real-time image processing, such as capturing video frames and detecting faces using methods like Haar Cascades or LBPH (Local Binary Pattern Histogram). LBPH in OpenCV is especially useful for recognizing faces under varying lighting conditions and angles, making it robust for real-time applications.

face_recognition: This package is built on top of OpenCV and deep learning models like dlib. It simplifies face detection and recognition tasks. It uses deep learning models for more accurate face recognition, enabling quick and reliable identification with just a few lines of code. The dlib-based facial landmark detection and encoding techniques used by face_recognition provide a high level of precision and flexibility in detecting and matching faces, making it ideal for a secure and reliable system.
