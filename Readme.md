I'll explain how face recognition works in this system and create a flow diagram of the process.

Core Components and Process:

1. Face Detection & Data Preparation
Uses OpenCV (cv2) for capturing video/image input
face_recognition library (built on dlib) for actual face detection
Images are processed in RGB format (converted from BGR when needed)
Frames are resized to 1/4 size (fx=0.25, fy=0.25) for better performance
2. Face Encoding Process
# Converting detected faces into numerical encodings
face_locations = face_recognition.face_locations(rgb_image)
face_encodings = face_recognition.face_encodings(rgb_image, face_locations)
3. Face Matching
matches = face_recognition.compare_faces(
    self.known_face_encodings,  # Pre-loaded known faces
    face_encoding,              # Current face to check
    tolerance=0.6              # Similarity threshold
)
Here's the architecture and flow diagram:
graph TD
    A[Start] --> B[Load Known Faces]
    B --> C[Initialize Video Capture]
    C --> D[Capture Frame]
    D --> E[Resize Frame to 0.25x]
    E --> F[Convert BGR to RGB]
    F --> G[Detect Face Locations]
    G --> H[Generate Face Encodings]
    H --> I{Compare with Known Faces}
    I -->|Match Found| J[Display Known Name]
    I -->|No Match| K[Mark as Unknown]
    K --> L[Save Unknown Face]
    L --> M[Send Email Alert]
    J --> N[Draw Bounding Box]
    M --> N
    N --> O[Display Frame]
    O --> P{Continue?}
    P -->|Yes| D
    P -->|No| Q[End]
- Key Technical Details:

1.Known Face Loading:
Faces are loaded from dataset_family directory
Supports JPG, JPEG, and PNG formats
Each image filename becomes the identity label
2.Face Detection Process:
Uses HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) method
Converts image to grayscale internally
Identifies facial landmarks (68 key points)
3.Face Encoding:
Creates 128-dimensional face embeddings
Uses deep neural network model
Encodings are numerical representations of facial features
4.Matching Process:
Compares 128-dimensional vectors
Uses tolerance=0.6 (lower = stricter matching)
Returns boolean array of matches
5.Real-time Processing:
Processes every other frame to improve performance
Uses small frame (0.25x) for detection
Scales coordinates back up (4x) for display
6.Security Features:
30-second cooldown between unknown face alerts
Email notifications for unknown faces
Separate notifications for file access attempts

This implementation provides a robust face recognition system with real-time processing and security alerting capabilities. The system balances accuracy with performance through smart frame processing and size optimization techniques.
